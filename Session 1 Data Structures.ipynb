Student with an ID 871 is the first one who walks into the class today, then student 872 follows, and student 873 arrives in the end. To present this information, we can create two lists with respect to the order of when each student walked in. Using indices, we retrieve the values from lists and show the ID of the first arrived student and that student's state.\n",
