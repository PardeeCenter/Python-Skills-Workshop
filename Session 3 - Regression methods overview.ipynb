    "Among the many useful quantitative methods employed in international relations analysis, multivariate regression is probably the most common.

A bivariate visualization of this process is below."

    "Also note that OLS comes in many shapes and sizes, and that its simplest form, which we'll demonstrate in this workshop, if often the least useful. This simple form is referred to as pooled regression, where all observations are considered to be independent and identically distributed. This can be a wildly incorrect assumption, particularly when multiple observations come from one individual/city/country/etc. \n",

This form of regression is known as \"fixed effects.\" Here, each unit as a unique intercept, which means that we can control for \"unit 1-ness,\" \"China-ness,\" or even \"1995-ness,\" without millions of other controls that describe what it means to be part of unit 1.

One type of regression model you might use here is the tobit model, pictured below.

    "So, why do we often see OLS used in analyses? It's fairly uncomplicated in mathematic sense, it has well-known statistical properties, it's available in every statistical analysis program you're likely to come across, and it's easy to interpret. A one-unit increase in x corresponds with a β-unit in y (if both x and y are logged, units are % -- an elasticity; if y is logged but x is not, it’s a semi-elasticity: (eβ – 1) * 100%).\n",

While it's output (log-odds, or odds ratios, if specified) can take some getting used to in terms of interpretation, its mathematics, similar to OLS, are fairly simple."
