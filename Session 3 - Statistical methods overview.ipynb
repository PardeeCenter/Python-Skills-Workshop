An example here would be counting up the number of high school track and field medals won by the individuals in this class. What is we wanted to create a statistical model that attempt to predict how many medals any randomly selected individual won? In this case, we'd want to examine the distribution of our dependent variable, the count of medals won. Odds are, if the typical count of medals per individual is fairly low, then that variable is described by a Poisson distribution. (Bonus tip: At high counts, the Poisson distribution skews toward normality.)"

However, Pearson  *r* correlations are only suitable for calculating the relationship between two continous variables, a continous variable and a dichotomous variable, (the technical term is a point biserial correlation), and two dichotomous variables (technically, a *phi* correlation).

It's fairly uncomplicated in mathematic sense, it has well-known statistical properties, it's available in every statistical analysis program you're likely to come across, and it's easy to interpret. A one-unit increase in x corresponds with a β-unit in y (if both x and y are logged, units are % -- an elasticity; if y is logged but x is not, it’s a semi-elasticity: (eβ – 1) * 100%).\n",
